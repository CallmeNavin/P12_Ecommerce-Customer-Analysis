**D. Key Findings & Actionable Plans**

**_Key Findings_**

- Home Category generates the highest revenue and AOV ‚Üí customers are willing to spend more ‚Üí sustainable profit driver.
- Electronics Category records the highest total orders (best-sellers) but lowest revenue & AOV ‚Üí popular in volume but not optimized for profitability ‚Üí mainly acts as a traffic driver.
- Customers tend to pay through credit cards, especially for Clothing & Electronics ‚Üí indicating easier spending when credit options are available.
- Revenue & Orders peak in mid-year (July‚ÄìAugust) but decline sharply in Q4.
- Customer Segmentation reveals a risky balance: Champions nearly equal Lost Customers, while Loyal & Potential segments remain underdeveloped (<6%) ‚Üí although high-value customers exist, churn risk is also significant.

**_Actionable Plans_**

- Category Strategy: Leverage Electronics as entry products, then design targeted cross-sell campaigns to Home items (e.g., desk, furniture, lighting for electronic buyers).
- Payment Method Strategy: Strengthen partnerships with banks (cashback, credit card promotions), especially for Clothing & Electronics.
- Seasonality Strategy: Maintain strong mid-year sales campaigns, but introduce additional Q4 incentives (Holiday Season, Black Friday, Christmas) to stabilize year-end performance.
- Customer Loyalty Strategy:
  + Develop exclusive care programs for Champions (membership, premium offers).
  + Convert Potential ‚Üí Loyal by:
    - Lowering loyalty thresholds by customer tier (e.g., fewer orders required to upgrade status).
    - Offering personalized recommendations based on last purchase.
    - Launching double-incentive campaigns to increase both frequency & monetary value (e.g., ‚ÄúOrder within 14 days ‚Üí +200 points. Orders above $60 ‚Üí extra 10% voucher‚Äù).
